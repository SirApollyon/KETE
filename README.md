Projekt KETE
This project is intended to show how a real estate search platform can be operated hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5. Based on criteria (e.g. education, transportation and nature), a heat map can be generated to filter offers according to these criteria. This project was developed as part of the Master of Science in Business Informatics.
